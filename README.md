# deskbot: How to add presets and automations to your BuzzFeed SF standing desk

The code in this repo is drawn from TJ Hunter's very great [photon-desk repo](https://github.com/Hypnopompia/photon-desk) which tells you how to convert your [V3 GeekDesk](http://www.geekdesk.com/geekdesk-v3-frame-only) into a desk with pre-sets. He even has [nifty controllers you can order](https://www.tindie.com/products/TJ_Hunter/photon-geekdesk-controller/) but this one just uses a [Photon](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-datasheet/) and [Photon Relay Shield](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-shields/#relay-shield) that you can buy from [the Particle store](http://store.particle.io). We're also going to show you how to use IFTTT to hook your desk pre-sets up to your phone.

You will need:

**Hardware**
- Photon
- Photon Relay Shield
- 3D printed case for the deskbot
- Long screws (like 3 inches)
- Your standing desk

**Software**
- A [Particle Build](http://build.particle.io) account
- An [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) account
- The [IFTTT "Do" app](https://ifttt.com/products/do/button)
- A Google account with Google Calendar
